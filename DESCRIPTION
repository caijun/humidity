Description: Vapor pressure, absolute humidity, specific humidity,
    and mixing ratio are commonly used water vapor measures in meteorology. This
    R package provides functions for calculating saturation vapor pressure (hPa), partial water vapor pressure (Pa), absolute
    humidity (kg/m^3), specific humidity (kg/kg), and mixing ratio (kg/kg) from
    temperature (K) and relative humidity (%).
