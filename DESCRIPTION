Description: Vapor pressure, relative humidity, absolute humidity, specific humidity, and mixing ratio are commonly used water vapor measures in meteorology. This R package provides functions for calculating saturation vapor pressure (hPa), partial water vapor pressure (Pa), relative humidity (%), absolute humidity (kg/m^3), specific humidity (kg/kg), and mixing ratio (kg/kg) from temperature (K) and dew point (K). Conversion functions between humidity measures are also provided.
